# Resolution

`interface` Resolution

This interface is used to measure how many pixels there are in each frame of a live video stream, both horizontally and vertically. For instance, a resolution of 1920x1080 signifies that the screen can display 1920 pixels across each row (width) and 1080 pixels down each column (height).

It is denoted by a pair of numbers:

* width: `number`

    Specifies the number of horizontal pixels.

* height: `number`
    
    Specfies the number of vertical pixels.
