# Resolution

The `Resolution` interface defines the resolution of a camera by specifying how many pixels there are in each frame of a video stream, both horizontally and vertically.

```ts
interface Resolution {
    height: number;
    width: number;
}
```

## height

The height of the video frame.

## width

The width of the video frame.
